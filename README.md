Hello Everyone!!
So, you need to download some modules in order to run this program. They are:
pytube - pip install pytube.
moviepy - pip install moviepy.
You just need to type these programs in cmd.
You need to copy the link address of the youtube video. In order to do that just hold the mouse button on the video and a pop will appear, from there you can copy the link address.
Ok! so, that's all  will be posting new programs very soon.
If you find any error please tell me and I will try to resolve the issue.
Thank You!!
